## Purpose

Accessibility is an increasingly important aspect of web development as many internet users require assistance -- such as screen readers -- to help read and navigate a web page efficiently. It also increases search engine positioning. 

The purpose of this refactor was to increase compliance with current accessibility standards and to update and simplify CSS for readability and efficiency for the future. Change made include:

1. Replaced non-semantic elements with semantic elements in HTML5.
2. Simplified CSS by removing duplicate coding.
3. Cleaned up CSS selectors in both CSS and HTML code.
4. Resturcted the CSS to match the structure of the HTML to improve side by side comparison.
5. Added alt attributes to images, where appropriate.
6. De-bug: Fixed broken Search Engine Optimization link
