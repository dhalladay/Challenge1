# Code Refactor Starter Code
Refactor of Horiseon Website

DESCRIPTION

Refactored code to increase accessibility of the Horiseon website. 

Accessibility is an increasingly important aspect of web development as many internet users require assistance -- such as screen readers -- to help read and navigate a web page efficiently. Replacing non-semantic and non-specific HTML elements with the semantic elements allowed in HTML5 provides better access and ease of use to these users. The CSS styling was also updated to improve speed and descrease the chances of issues with the website on future updates. 

1. Removed duplicated code in CSS
2. Replaced non-semantic elements with semantic elements in HTML5.
3. Cleaned up CSS selectors in both CSS and HTML code.
4. Resturcted the CSS to match the structure of the HTML to improve side by side comparison.
5. Added alt attributes to images, where appropriate.
6. Fixed broken Search Engine Optimization link
